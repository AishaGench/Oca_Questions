    int [] array ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    /*
    And given the requirements:
    1.Process all the elements of the array in the order of entry. --> enhanced loop, standard loop, simple loop
    2.Process all the elements of the array in the reverse order of entry. --> simple loop
    3.Process alternating elements of the array in the order of entry.  ---> simple loop

    Which two statements are true?(Choose two)

    A.Requirements1,2,and 3can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.
    B.Requirements1,2,and 3 can be implemented by using the standard for loop.
    C.Requirements 2 and 3 CANNOT be implemented by using the standard for loop.
    D.Requirement 1 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop



    Answer is: B D
